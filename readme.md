## Utah Jazz Web Scraper

Backend was made with Node.js, Express, Cheerio, and Axios.

### `About`

I wanted to try and build an app using a web scraper. The goal was to create a backend in Node, scrape info from NBA.com and ESPN.com and push it to a frontend running React.

The code base is a bit messy but I have plans to clean it up in the future.

There is a feature to watch the Utah Jazz games via a stream that is scraped from another site. The site uses HTTP so proceed with caution if streaming.

I do not own any of the data that is scraped from these web sites. This project was for educational purposes only.

NOTE: App currently takes a while to load up. Need to find way to speed up process.
